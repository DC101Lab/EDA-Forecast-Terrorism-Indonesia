# EDA and Forecast terrorism in Indonesia using Prophet

## Project Overview
To facilitate this objective, We're using the Global Terrorism Database (GTD), which is maintained by the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START) at the University of Maryland, a large dataset that provides an opportunity to use Python for data cleansing, exploratory data analysis, visualizations, feature engineering and machine learning.  In addition, selecting the topic of terrorism is applicable to the current state of events across the world.


## Data Type and Characteristics
The data distribution from START contains 181,691 observations and 135 attributes describing terrorist attacks across the world.  The data covers the time period between 1970 through 2016, except for 1993.  The attributes consist of numeric, categorical, character, and time series values.  A brief visual analysis shows many attributes contain missing values and some have a high cardinality.
